  Content: 'Disaster always falls on the less fortunate, and Vivian dies one night
    after being hit by a car driven by a drunk driver and taken to the hospital.
    The news was a major blow to Atticus, who felt his life was once again plunged
    into darkness and unable to extricate himself. He begins to doubt his life and
    destiny, and the pain and depression overwhelm him again. He feels that he has
    lost everything and his life has become meaningless.

    Atticus could not accept
    Vivian''s departure, he could not forget her smile and love, and the good times
    they had together. He feels that he has lost all hope and motivation, and that
    life has become meaningless. Atticus is in deep despair, unable to extricate
    himself, and he needs time and support to come out gradually.'
