  Content: "Atticus' childhood was full of pain and loneliness; \nhe grew up in a
    family where his parents often quarreled, his father worked outside all the time,
    and his mother was too passive and silent, and Atticus felt abandoned. Atticus'
    parents' personality disagreement, poor communication, professional pressure,
    and relatives caused Atticus' father's behavior of leaving the family.\r\nLack
    of role models. Atticus may not receive enough male role models to understand
    the development of masculine traits and social roles and to learn how to interact
    and build interpersonal relationships.\r\n"
