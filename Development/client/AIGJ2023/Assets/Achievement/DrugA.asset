  Content: 'Atticus began to look for a solution and went to see a doctor, but he
    was told that he needed to improve his diet and take his time with his regimen.
    But because of his family''s limitations, Atticus found it difficult to improve
    his diet, and he became increasingly helpless and depressed.

    In the process,
    Atticus was introduced to medicines, which he found could make him feel good
    and energetic, helping him forget about pain and stress. So he began to take
    the drugs often in order to feel good for a short period of time.

    However,
    over time, Atticus became dependent on the drugs and had more and more difficulty
    controlling his behavior and emotions. With frequent mood swings and out-of-control
    behavior, he realized that his problems had become so severe that he needed help.'
