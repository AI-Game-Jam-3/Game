  Content: 'It was not until Atticus came into contact with game consoles game consoles
    can provide a virtual world in which Atticus can temporarily forget his worries
    and depression and enjoy the virtual pleasure and excitement.

    Atticus may
    gradually become addicted to game consoles because of his inner emotional problems.
    He may spend a lot of time on game consoles and neglect important things and
    relationships in real life. He may use the game console as his refuge and as
    soon as he encounters a problem, he will immediately hide in the world of the
    game console instead of facing and solving the problem head-on.'
