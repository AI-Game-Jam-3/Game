  Content: 'Atticus was annoyed and upset by his peers'' lack of understanding, but
    he didn''t dare to speak up and had to suffer in silence. But in one of the more
    intense bullying incidents, the bear doll was viciously destroyed by his peers,
    and Atticus felt overwhelmed with pain and loss.

    Atticus felt he had lost
    the only memento his father had left him, the only comfort and support he had.
    He felt alone and helpless, unable to understand why his hobbies and habits had
    led to such a result. For Atticus, this vicious attack may leave him feeling
    alone, helpless, and unsettled. He may feel different from his peers and unable
    to fit in with their circle.'
