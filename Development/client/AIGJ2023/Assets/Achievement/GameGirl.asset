  Content: 'Although gaming consoles can temporarily relieve Atticus'' pain and depression,
    this escape does not fundamentally solve his problems. Prolonged addiction to
    gaming consoles may have negative effects, such as social isolation, psychological
    dependence, and depression, among others.

    But being the hero of the world
    within the game is so fascinating and desirable, Atticus, what should you choose.'
