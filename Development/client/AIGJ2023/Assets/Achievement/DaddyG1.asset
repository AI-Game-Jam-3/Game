  Content: 'Atticus''s father left a doll for Atticus when he left, and this doll
    is one of Atticus''s most treasured possessions because it was left to him by
    his father. Atticus would hold this bear doll every day and talk and play with
    it, which made him feel very happy and comfortable.

    However, Atticus''
    peers around him did not understand him, they thought it was childish and not
    funny to hold the bear doll.

    So, his peers started to bad-mouth him and
    laugh at his bear doll, making him feel very ashamed and helpless. One day, Atticus
    put the bear doll on his desk in the classroom, but his peers found it and started
    making fun of its look and appearance.'
